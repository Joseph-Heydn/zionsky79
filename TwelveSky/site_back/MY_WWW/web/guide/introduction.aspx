							        <li>In the beginning, the land of China was vast, and as people began to explore the lands they found themselves surrounded by dangerous monsters of all kinds. Banding together to protect one another from the hidden dangers in their lands, these people eventually formed clans, creating factions to protect one another and dominate all monsters around them until they were masters of all they surveyed, going from strength to strength!</li>

						        <ul>
							        <li>Soon the seperate factions became aware of one another as they grew and expanded from their home towns, inevitably meeting on a common battlefield to fight for strategic advantage, hoping to crush and conquer all other factions, until they are the only survivors and the most dominant faction in the land!</li>
						        </ul>

						        <ul>
							        <li>The first of these factions is the imperial dragon faction. They are a group of people forming one of the more balanced clans of warriors in the game. Travelling from the territories to the East, the Imperial Dragon Clan are Masters of the Heavy Sword, the Light Sword, and the long ranging mysterious Marble weapon. These fierce warriors use their indominitable spirit with deadly accuracy. Proud and loyal, these warriors would rather fight to the death than surrender one inch of ground to an enemy. Their Chieftain, Lord Yudi, was one of the few who had seen the mighty power of the great TwelveSky and lived to tell the tale.</li>

					        </div>
					        <div class="con_text">
						        <ul>
							        <li>The second of these clans are faraway from the frozen wastelands to the North. They are known only as the Royal Snake Clan. Under the command of the greatly feared and haunting specter of Shadowless Needle Lord, Seto they are masters of an awesome amount of great and spectacular weapons. These aggressive warriors are able to devise ways to manipulate the most graceful and sublime sound waves in order to stealthy torture and exterminate victims over vast distances.</li>

					        </div>
					        <div class="con_text">
						        <ul>
							        <li>The last of these great clans come from the mountainous and barren regions to the west where few men dare to go. They are called the Fierce Tiger Clan, and their very name brings a hush of awe to anyone daring to speak their name aloud. These powerful warriors rely upon their sheer brute strength, and for good reason! Unlike the Snake Clan, these combatants are far superior in terms of physical stature alone. Able to wield gigantic spears and blades with a single hand, a solitary warrior would be foolish to under estimate them. Many men have perished due to their overconfidence when fighting a fierce tiger, "strong and accurate no one has yet to survive challenging the Demonic Ruler Lord Reni to a duel."</li>

							        <li>One last unexplained mystery remains for all to discover. Many many years ago, in a time far past there was a catastrophy that caused the death of a nation so strong that their name became legend. The great sky clan were destroyed so long ago when the ground opened and met the sky, heaving a great plume of smoke high, covering the sun, and drowning the entire "region of the Sky Clan with it's deathly shroud of black."</li>

						        <ul>
							        <li>For years the people had believed the Saga Swordsman and the rest of the Sky Clan had perished in that fatal blast, and with the loss of Lord Chen the land was left without a leader. Now the land begins to bleed as the three clans fight for supremacy and the cries of its people spread.</li>

							        <li>"TwelveSky2 WSP" is an adrenaline-pumping Massively Multiplayer Online Role Play Game (MMORPG).
