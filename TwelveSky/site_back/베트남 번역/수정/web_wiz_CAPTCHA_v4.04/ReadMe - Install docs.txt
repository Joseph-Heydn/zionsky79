Introduction
===========================================================================================
Thank you for downloading this application and hopefully you will find it of benefit to you.

Web Wiz CAPTCHA has been designed so that it can be integrated into your own sites web forms
in the most simplest way.

Web Wiz CAPTCHA adds a security code in image format to your web forms that requires the user
to type in the correct code, shown in image format, into a textbox so that the submitted web
form is then processed.

The idea of CAPTCHA images is that robots, OCR software, etc. can not read in the CAPTCHA image 
code and so therefore can not correctly submit the form. This is useful to protect your web forms
form hacking and spamming software robots and remote form submission.
